Hey Guys. This is my university project build in 2012-2013 to help university students of Mumbai to browse through the course curriculum free. 

These seems very obvious and naive today, back then we had no means in India/Mumbai to look at these conctent which we are tested for in the exams. Students had to rely and depend on their colleages.Who would also have these detials only in hard copy, availble on request basis at a fee.

The project aimed to democratise the fundamental knowledge and rigth of studnets have this information. 

Thas writen on google cloud engine, using Adobe Phone gap, HTMl templates and pdf files for docuemtns. That was a decent attempt for then. Now it needs a refresh and open to people looking to upgrade this to current code partices/libraries and frameworks.
